# Simple-Calculator-User-Greeting
Overview 🌟
This is a beginner-friendly Python project where I learned about:
  Variables: storing information like numbers and names
  User Input/Output :asking user for input and printing results
  Basic Arithmetic Operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
  If-Else Statements:handling simple conditions  

The program greets the user by their name and performs **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** on two numbers. It also **checks division by zero** using a simple if-else statemen
